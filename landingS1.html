												<h3>DISCRETE STRUCTURE</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This course introduces students to the principles and applications of discrete structure in the
												field of computer science. The topics that are covered in this course are set theory, proof
												techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees
												and finite automata. At the end of the course, the students should be able to use set theory,
												relations and functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and solve problems
												using recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees in real world
												problems and use deterministic finite automata finite state machines to model electronic
												devices and problems.</p>

												<h3>PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE 1</h3>
											</header>
											<p>As a fundamental subject, this course equips the students with theory and practice on
												problem solving techniques by using the structured approach. Students are required to
												develop programs using C++ programming language, in order to solve simple to moderate
												problems. The course covers the following: pre-processor directives, constants and
												variables, data types, input and output statements, control structures: sequential, selection
												and loop, built-in and user-defined functions, single and two-dimensional arrays, file
												operations, pointers, and structured data types.</p>

												<h3>DIGITAL LOGIC</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Digital electronics is the foundation of all microprocessor-based systems found in computers,
												robots, automobiles, and industrial control systems. This course introduces the students to
												digital electronics and provides a broad overview of many important concepts, components,
												and tools. Students will get up-to-date coverage of digital fundamentals-from basic concepts
												to programmable logic devices. Laboratory experiments provide hands-on experience with
												the simulator software, actual devices and circuits studied in the classroom.</p>

												<h3>TECHNOLOGY&INFORMATION SYSTEM</h3>
											</header>
											<p>As a primer subject, this course will introduce students to information systems and
												technology (IS/IT) and the emerging trends of IS/IT, as well as its uses in daily life both at
												home and at work. Various aspects of IS/IT encompassing hardware, software, network,
												communications, internet, multimedia, graphics, systems applications, 4IR, cloud computing
												and data analytics will be introduced. Students will be equipped with basic skills in setting up
												and handling cloud server via practical work in the virtual guided lab, which shall comprise a
												major part of the study. At the end of the course, student should be able to distinguish basic
												IS/IT component and applications.</p>

												<h3>INTEGRITY&ANTI-CORRUPTION</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This course highlights the main core of UTM which is a driving force for creative
												and innovative human capital to meet the needs of the country in the future. The
												main core is Integrity, Synergy, Excellence and Sustainability (ISES – Integrity,
												Synergy, Excellence and Sustainability). The basic concept that underlies this course
												is the value of integrity, value and self-identity that can curb all forms of misuse of
												power in everyday life and in organizations such as corruption; and anti-corruption
												measures.</p>

												<h3>ENGLISH COMMUNICATION SKILLS</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This English course is designed to reinforce and enhance students’ existing English
												Language skills to enable them to communicate better in their current surrounding
												(higher education setting). Through guided and independent learning activities,
												students will develop their skills in reading, listening, writing as well as speaking. At the
												end of the course, students should be able to recognise relevant information in texts on
												topics of interest. Students should also be able to write on familiar topics. Additionally,
												this course will provide students with opportunities to enhance their listening and
												speaking skills.</p>
